## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

#### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

#### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
Project Overview
This project is a complete university course assignment that covers key aspects of game development: input handling, rendering, collision detection, resource management, and battle logic. It features a clear structure and is designed for easy expansion.

## Project Overview
This project is a complete university course assignment that covers key aspects of game development: input handling, rendering, collision detection, resource management, and battle logic. It features a clear structure and is designed for easy expansion.

The project is a Java-based remake of the third generation of the globally renowned Pokémon game series. It is a 2D pixel-style turn-based game that employs common 2D game design elements such as tilemaps and sprites. The entire game is controlled via keyboard inputs and runs within a single thread.

## Controls Guide
W, A, S, D – Control character direction and menu cursor

ENTER – Confirm selection, interact, play fishing animation

I – Toggle debug mode

ESC – Go back / open menu

## 项目简介
该项目为一份完整的大学课程设计，覆盖游戏开发主要环节：输入、渲染、碰撞、资源管理与战斗逻辑。结构清晰，易于扩展。本项目主题是全世界知名IP宝可梦游戏的第三世代在JAVA上的复刻，是一款2d像素回合制游戏。采用瓦片地图和精灵图等常见2d游戏设计。全游戏通过键盘控制，游戏在一个单线程中完成。

## 操作指南
